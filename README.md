# Functions
Compilation of functions to reduce raw data from touchscreen and eye tracking tasks. These tasks were employed for two studies (toddlers and babies) that are part of the Doctoral Thesis of **Sebastián Moyano Flores**. The studies took place at the Research Centre for Mind, Brain and Behaviour (CIMCYC - University of Granada) under the supervision of Dr. M. Rosario Rueda Cuerva (https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dTFQyuMAAAAJ&hl=en).

**BEXAT (Babies Executive Attention) study:** <br>
This longitudinal study was supervised by Dr. M. Rosario Rueda and conducted in the Research Centre for Mind, Brain and Behaviour (CIMCYC - University of Granada). The main goal of the project is to characterize the development of executive attention following babies from 6 to 30 months, employing behavioural and different state-of-the-art techniques as eye tracking (Eyelink 1000Plus - SR Research) or electroencephalography (High density EEG 128 channels - Magstim EGI).

**TALDEV (Toddler's Attention and Language Development) study:** <br>
This accelerated longitudinal study was supervised by Dr. M. Rosario Rueda and conducted in the Research Centre for Mind, Brain and Behaviour (CIMCYC - University of Granada). The main goal of the project is to characterize the development of attention in toddlers, running two sessions spaced for 6 months. Behavioural and eye tracking (SMI RED250mobile - SensoMotoric Instruments) techniques were employed.


**Touchscreen tasks were built in Open Sesame and included:**
1. Spatial conflict task (Gerardi-Caulton, 2000)
2. Orienting task
3. Alerting task
4. Young-Child ANT task (Rueda et al., 2004)

**Eye tracking tasks were built in Experiment Center (SensoMotoric Instruments, SMI) and Experiment Builder (SR Research):** <br>
*- Data was reduced employing I2MC algorithm by Hessels et al. (2017)*
1. Visual Sequence Learning task (Clohessy et al., 2001)
2. Gap-Overlap task
3. Switching task (Kovács & Mehler, 2009)
4. Backward Semantic Inhibition task (Chow et al., 2016)
